## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Dashboard Design

-   Uses a sophisticated grid layout with golden ratio proportions

-   Interactive elements for period selection

### User Experience

-   Hover effects and transitions for better interactivity

## Current State Assessment

The member dashboard appears to be well-developed with:

-   ✅ Responsive design implementation

## Potential Areas for Enhancement
